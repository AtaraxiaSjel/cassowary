# 4. Building cassowary from source
Install wine first in order to build windows application on linux, internet is required to download python binary for setup 

```
$ git clone https:// github.com/casualsnek/cassowary
$ cd cassowary
$ ./buildall.sh
```

This will result a dist folder inside app-linux which contains the installed wheel file
also a bin folder will be created in app-windows containing the setup files

# 5. How can i help ?
- Improve the README.md
- Report bugs or submit patches
- Maybe video instructions for new users, or add screenshots with the setup instructions
- Maybe donate so i can spend some more time maintaining it !
